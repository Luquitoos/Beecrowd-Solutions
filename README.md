<h4>The codes available in this repository reflect an early stage of my programming learning journey. It is important to emphasize that they do not necessarily represent the best practices or approaches that I currently adopt.</h4>

<h4>During the period in which they were written, these codes may contain errors or not follow currently accepted standards. However, they are made available here with the aim of contributing to the community and offering diverse solutions to common problems.</h4>

<h4>It is recommended that you do not use these codes as a direct reference for professional projects or applications, considering that my programming methodology has evolved since then, adopting more efficient approaches aligned with industry best practices.</h4>
